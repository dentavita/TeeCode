TeeCode
=======

TeeCode is a new kind of component-based programming language, just for fun.

Data and instructions have their Component equivalents (TWhile, TIf, TFor, TFunction, TVariable, etc) so they can be placed visually on forms, and interconnect them using properties.

These forms can be conceptually devised as Class definitions, so to create an instance you create a form.
By using events, you can inject custom code at any execution step, or for example at any variable setter or getter.

Creating derived classes is done by creating inherited forms and then adding or overriding base components.

Renderer component helpers can convert a tree structure into any human-readable language, like Delphi, C# or whatever.

A Runner component allows execution and simple debugging.
